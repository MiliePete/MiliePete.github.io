            <h4>I do a lot of things in self quarantine. I'm not allowed to go out on Sundays. It's not really quarantine anymore, it's just that we have a 07:00 curfew. I have a friend that's also my neighbor. Our gardens share a wall. I also play with my dog Isabella, She's <em>REALLY</em> cute! I like to sing and dance, as well! I like crafting stuff and using colored pencils as make-up! I kinda wish lockdown never ends because I have so many new hobbies! But that doesn't mean I don't study! I have online school and I can talk to my school friends there! My teachers give homework through mail and they give assignments through the assignments category! It's really fun in quarantine once ya think about it! I even leared how to code this blog in this lockdown! But that's all I'm gonna write about <em>MY</em> quarantine. I might write another one though, so keep an eye out for that! So that's it for today, see ya in my next blog! Bye!ðŸ˜Š
