<h2>So as you can see, there are some rules you must follow in this group. I've made this list of rules you MUST follow in this group.</h2><h3>(THIS GROUP IS FOR BONDING PUPOSES ONLY)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>NO enemies will be made in this group. If you are in a fight with somebody, just solve your problems in another group or private chat.
        <li>You CAN add anyone. If you think I'll get mad at who you add, then you might be right. But I won't say anything. Feel free(this isn't a rule, add anybody if you wanna).
        <li>DO NOT(and I mean) DO. NOT. REMOVE ANYBODY PEOPLE! If you wanna remove somebody, then you can if you ask permission from at least 2 people from the group including me. So ask me and somebody else, and if we both say 'ok', you're good to go. Same thing with changing the group's name.
        <li>Do not CURSE. I mean, c'mon! There might even be first graders! And me myself, am only nine years old! You can only say semi-bad words like... umm... I DON'T WANNA CURSE! Like c**p and s**t. And you NEED to put stars! Even otherwise, please, just don't curse!
    </ol>
