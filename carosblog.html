 <h1>Caro's blog</h1>
 <h4>Hello! I'm Caroline, but you can call me Caro! It sounds more unique!<br><br>I am currently working in Stalwart People Services India Limited.<Br>  I live with my husband, daughter and dog.<br>  My husband is a computer scientist/engineer although he is not coding this blog. He is helping me work on an app for work.<br> My daughter recently learned coding and she is the one making this blog for me while I am writing it. She is also quite good at singing.<br> My dogâ€™s professions are ruining dresses, biting us until we bleed, disturbing the neighbours by barking and eating all the flowers that I buy. What else can I ask for? She is extremely cute and furry, she is a golden retriever. She loves bones and hugs.<br> And thatâ€™s my whole family.<br> I live in a villa in the outskirts of Bengaluru.<br> 
Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m going to write in this blog, I might write another one. Until then, bye!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Ž
