  <h2>1: Giant bubble maker</h2>
  <h4>This first hack teaches you how to make giant soap bubbles! First, get some twine. Then get a parent to help you cut it into a large string(or you could use a thin strip of cloth instead). Tie it into a circle. Then grab a plate. And also a cup. Pour in some water and shampoo or dish soap.. Mix it well  but gently so that it doesn't become foam. Then pour the liquid onto the plate. Carefully put the twine on the plate, so that it floats on the soapy water. Leave it until it slightly sinks. Once it does, remove the twine <em>VERY</em> carefully. Then, either blow or hold the top corners and run around. We suggest doing this hack outside. </h4>
  <h2>2:Sock puppets</h2>
  <h5>Tip: If permanent marker gets on furniture, use toothpaste to remove it!</h5>
