   <h1>Stuff to do when you're bored</h1> 
   <h2>By Mila Mendez and Nina Bansal</h2>
   <h3>If you're anything like us, you're probably bored out of your mind right now! So here are 15 hacks (and some parental guidence) to get you feeling a lot less bored!</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>3-5 years
      <li>6-7 years
      <li>8-12 years
  </ul>
  <h2>3-5 years(needs adult supervison)</h2>
  <h3>Projects:
  </h3>
  <ol>
      <li>Giant bubble maker
      <li>Sock puppets
      <li>Finger-painted ladybugs
      <li>
      <li>
  </ol>
  <h2>1: Giant bubble maker</h2>
  <h4>This first hack teaches you how to make giant soap bubbles! First, get some twine. Then get a parent to help you cut it into a large string(or you could use a thin strip of cloth instead). Tie it into a circle. Then grab a plate. And also a cup. Pour in some water and shampoo or dish soap.. Mix it well  but gently so that it doesn't become foam. Then pour the liquid onto the plate. Carefully put the twine on the plate, so that it floats on the soapy water. Leave it until it slightly sinks. Once it does, remove the twine <em>VERY</em> carefully. Then, either blow or hold the top corners and run around. We suggest doing this hack outside. </h4>
  <h2>2:Sock puppets</h2>
  <h4>Take an old sock first. But instead of putting it on your hand, put it on your hand!</h4>
  <h5>Tip: If permanent marker gets on furniture, use toothpaste to remove it!</h5>
  <h2>Finger-painted ladybugs</h2>
  <h3>First, get out some red paint. Then pour it on a small paper plate. Now bring out a black marker. Take out an A4 sized piece of paper. Now dip one of your fingertips in on the plate. Now layer your finger over the paper. Make sure to give a little pressure while doing so. It should make a red oval. Now wait for it to dry for 10 mins. Make sure to wash the paint of your fingers while its drying! Once its dried, grab your black marker and draw little circles on the ladybug. Make sure to color them! Now draw a head and some antenna with your black marker. And now you're done!</h3>

      <li>Foam bubbles in a mug
      <li>Toilet paper roll fairies

  </ol>
  <h2> 1: Foam bubbles in a mug</h2>
  <h4>First take a bathing mug (or you could use a bowl). Then pour some water into it. After that, take some soap, either dish soap or shampoo. Mix it all gently with a spoon, straw or chopstick. Make sure you mix gently so that no foam forms! Then after that, grab a straw. Put the straw in the mug or bowl. Then put your mouth on the straw like you are going to drink it. But instead of drinking it, blow into the straw and watch the foam bubbles form! /!\ Make sure not to swallow it! /!\ We recommend doing this in your kitchen, bathroom, ballcony/terrace/garden. Please do not do this around public places like parks and streets. Also do not do around soft furniture like beds, sofas, or cushioned chairs. </h4>
  <h2>Toilet paper roll fairies</h2>
  <h4>Take an empty toilet paper roll, then grab some googly eyes or if you don't have them, you could use fabric/permanent marker.</h4>
  <h2>8-12 years</h2>

  <h2>DIY putty slime</h2>
  <h4>For this reciepe, you will need special glue. You will need silicon glue. It is very easy to do. Get as much glue as you want first. Then add some paint or food color. Then add some glitter. The glitter and color, are of course not compulsary. Then add some water to the mixture. Mix well. Store safetly in an airtight box. After one or two days it will turn into a putty. You now have a nice putty slime that you've made yourself!</h4>
